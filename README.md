### Task Definition

The mBot starts moving forward from the starting position. Once the mBot encounters a black line, it stops, and detects the colour of the sheet of paper underneath it, and turns in the direction according to the colour of the paper. When the mBot stops at the last black line with a white sheet of paper, it should play a celebratory tune.
